Project has 3 major phases:
1. Time series characterisation: to check whether or not time series have trends, are stationary, are seasonal, are cyclical or random to inform the decision on appropriate models 

- Check existence of trends, cyclical, stationarity and/or seasonality patterns (Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots)
![Example plots for characterisation - ACF & PACF](https://github.com/wgova/time_series_trade/blob/master/images/engine_parts/rca_tests/acf_pacf/South%20Africa_ACF_PACF.png)

- Moving average
![Example plots for characterisation - rolling stats](https://github.com/wgova/time_series_trade/blob/master/images/engine_parts/rca_tests/rolling_stats/South%20Africa_Rolling_Stats.png)

-  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test


2. Time series clustering and classification



3. Time series forecasting
