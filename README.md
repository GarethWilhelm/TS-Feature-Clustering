Project has 3 major phases for 2 major experiments (i. export value and ii. rca values):
1. Exploratory data analysis: to check overall trends, patterns, outliers and suspicious data
 	- ![Global trends in exports](https://github.com/wgova/time_series_trade/blob/master/images/engine_parts/rca_tests/Exports%20for%20engine_parts.png)
	
	- ![Histograms: to illustrate frequency distributions] ()
 
2. Time series characterisation: to check whether or not time series have trends, are stationary, are seasonal, are cyclical or random to inform the decision on appropriate models 
	
	- Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots:
	Check existence of trends, cyclical, stationarity and/or seasonality patterns ()
![Example plots for characterisation - ACF & PACF](https://github.com/wgova/time_series_trade/blob/master/images/engine_parts/rca_tests/acf_pacf/South%20Africa_ACF_PACF.png)

	- Moving average
![Example plots for characterisation - rolling stats](https://github.com/wgova/time_series_trade/blob/master/images/engine_parts/rca_tests/rolling_stats/South%20Africa_Rolling_Stats.png)
	-  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test


3. Time series clustering and classification
 - In progress: Literature review

4. Time series forecasting
 - Planning:
